            About Southern Brief
          </h1>
          <p className="text-sm sans text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl">
            Southern Brief starts from a simple claim: Washington squandered the
            moral and strategic capital it once held in the hemisphere. Instead
            of guarding a stable American sphere, it chased crusades abroad,
            opened its markets and borders without limit, exported its industry,
            and taught every rival how to bypass its leverage.

            This site follows the consequences of that retreat in the Southern
            Cone: how power realigns, how institutions bend, and how ordinary
            citizens absorb the shocks. The voice is deliberately local and
            legalistic, not diplomatic—grounded in texts, constitutions and
            trade law rather than talking‑point multilateralism.

            Southern Brief is edited by Vinicivs‑M. Blanchard, a Generation Z
            lawyer who writes from the South but reads the world through old‑
            fashioned lenses: sovereignty over fashion, order over spectacle,
            and clarity over euphemism.
