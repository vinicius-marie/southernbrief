Matthew 5:3-12 [3] Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [4] Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land. [5] Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. [6] Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall have their fill. [7] Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. [8] Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God. [9] Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God. [10] Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [11] Blessed are ye when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all that is evil against you, untruly, for my sake: [12] Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven.
John 14:1-6 [1] Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God: believe also in me. [2] In my Father's house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you. [3] And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be. [4] And whither I go you know, and the way you know. [5] Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? [6] Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.
Matthew 11:28-30 [28] Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you. [29] Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart: and you shall find rest to your souls. [30] For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.
John 3:16-21 [16] For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting. [17] For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him. [18] He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. [19] And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil. [20] For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved. [21] But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they are done in God.
Luke 1:46-55 [46] And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord. [47] And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. [48] Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. [49] Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his name. [50] And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him. [51] He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. [52] He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble. [53] He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. [54] He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy: [55] As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
John 15:1-8 [1] I am the true vine; and my Father is the husbandman. [2] Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit. [3] Now you are clean by reason of the word, which I have spoken to you. [4] Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me. [5] I am the vine; you the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing. [6] If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth. [7] If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you. [8] In this is my Father glorified; that you bring forth very much fruit, and become my disciples.
Romans 8:31-39 [31] What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us? [32] He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things? [33] Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God that justifieth. [34] Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died, yea that is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. [35] Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or famine? or nakedness? or danger? or persecution? or the sword? [36] (As it is written: For thy sake we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) [37] But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us. [38] For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might, [39] Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Philippians 4:4-9 [4] Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice. [5] Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh. [6] Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God. [7] And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. [8] For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things. [9] The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.
1Corinthians 13:1-8 [1] If I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. [2] And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. [3] And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. [4] Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up; [5] Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil; [6] Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth; [7] Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. [8] Charity never falleth away.
Romans 12:9-21 [9] Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that which is good. [10] Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing one another. [11] In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving the Lord. [12] Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in prayer. [13] Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality. [14] Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not. [15] Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep. [16] Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits. [17] To no man rendering evil for evil. Providing good things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men. [18] If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men. [19] Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto wrath, for it is written: Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord. [20] But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. [21] Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.
Ephesians 6:10-18 [10] Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power. [11] Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil. [12] For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places. [13] Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect. [14] Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of justice, [15] And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace: [16] In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one. [17] And take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God). [18] By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit; and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints.
Psalms 23:1-6 [1] The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing. [2] He hath set me in a place of pasture. He hath brought me up, on the water of refreshment: [3] He hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake. [4] For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me. [5] Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly is it! [6] And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
Psalms 91:1-16 [1] He that dwelleth in the aid of the most High, shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob. [2] He shall say to the Lord: Thou art my protector, and my refuge: my God, in him will I trust. [3] For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters: and from the sharp word. [4] He will overshadow thee with his shoulders: and under his wings thou shalt trust. [5] His truth shall compass thee with a shield: thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night. [6] Of the arrow that flieth in the day, of the business that walketh about in the dark: of invasion, or of the noonday devil. [7] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee. [8] But thou shalt consider with thy eyes: and shalt see the reward of the wicked. [9] Because thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou hast made the most High thy refuge. [10] There shall no evil come to thee: nor shall the scourge come near thy dwelling. [11] For he hath given his angels charge over thee; to keep thee in all thy ways. [12] In their hands they shall bear thee up: lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. [13] Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon. [14] Because he hoped in me I will deliver him: I will protect him because he hath known my name. [15] He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: I am with him in tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him. [16] I will fill him with length of days; and I will shew him my salvation.
Psalms 46:1-11 [1] God is our refuge and strength: a helper in troubles, which have found us exceedingly. [2] Therefore we will not fear, when the earth shall be troubled; and the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea. [3] Their waters roared and were troubled: the mountains were troubled with his strength. [4] The stream of the river maketh the city of God joyful: the most High hath sanctified his own tabernacle. [5] God is in the midst thereof, it shall not be moved: God will help it in the morning early. [6] Nations were troubled, and kingdoms were bowed down: he uttered his voice, the earth trembled. [7] The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector. [8] Come and behold ye the works of the Lord: what wonders he hath done upon earth, [9] Making wars to cease even to the end of the earth. He shall destroy the bow, and break the weapons: and the shield he shall burn in the fire. [10] Be still and see that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth. [11] The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector.
Psalms 103:1-13 [1] For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is within me bless his holy name. [2] Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee. [3] Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases. [4] Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion. [5] Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's. [6] The Lord doth mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong. [7] He hath made his ways known to Moses: his wills to the children of Israel. [8] The Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and plenteous in mercy. [9] He will not always be angry: nor will he threaten for ever. [10] He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. [11] For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him. [12] As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our iniquities from us. [13] As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him.
Proverbs 3:1-12 [1] My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments. [2] For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life and peace. [3] Let not mercy and truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the tables of thy heart: [4] And thou shalt find grace, and good understanding before God and men. [5] Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence. [6] In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps. [7] Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil: [8] For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones. [9] Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of all thy fruits: [10] And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall run over with wine. [11] My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint when thou art chastised by him: [12] For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself.
Ecclesiasticus 2:1-11 [1] Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation. [2] Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds. [3] Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end. [4] Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience. [5] For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. [6] Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein. [7] Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him, lest ye fall. [8] Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void. [9] Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come to you for your delight. [10] Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened. [11] My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.
Isaiah 40:28-31 [28] Knowest thou not, or hast thou not heard? the Lord is the everlasting God, who hath created the ends of the earth: he shall not faint, nor labour, neither is there any searching out of his wisdom. [29] It is he that giveth strength to the weary, and increaseth force and might to them that are not. [30] Youths shall faint, and labour, and young men shall fall by infirmity. [31] But they that hope in the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall take wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.
Jeremiah 29:11-14 [11] For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of affliction, to give you an end and patience. [12] And you shall call upon me, and you shall go: and you shall pray to me, and I will hear you. [13] You shall seek me, and shall find me: when you shall seek me with all your heart. [14] And I will be found by you, saith the Lord: and I will bring back your captivity, and I will gather you out of all nations, and from all the places to which I have driven you out, saith the Lord: and I will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to be carried away captive.
Isaiah 41:10-13 [10] Fear not, for I am with thee: turn not aside, for I am thy God: I have strengthened thee, and have helped thee, and the right hand of my just one hath upheld thee. [11] Behold all that fight against thee shall be confounded and ashamed, they shall be as nothing, and the men shall perish that strive against thee. [12] Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find the men that resist thee: they shall be as nothing: and as a thing consumed the men that war against thee. [13] For I am the Lord thy God, who take thee by the hand, and say to thee: Fear not, I have helped thee.
James 1:2-12 [2] My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations; [3] Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience. [4] And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing. [5] But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. [6] But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind. [7] Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. [8] A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways. [9] But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation: [10] And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away. [11] For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the appearance thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. [12] Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.
1Peter 5:6-11 [6] Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation: [7] Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you. [8] Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour. [9] Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls your brethren who are in the world. [10] But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you, and confirm you, and establish you. [11] To him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.
1John 4:7-16 [7] Dearly beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. And every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. [8] He that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is charity. [9] By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him. [10] In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins. [11] My dearest, if God hath so loved us; we also ought to love one another. [12] No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his charity is perfected in us. [13] In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit. [14] And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. [15] Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. [16] And we have known, and have believed the charity, which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him.
